abstract: This paper introduces MACH, a novel approach for optimizing task handover
  in vehicular computing scenarios. To ensure fast and latency-aware placement of
  tasks, the decision-making -- where and when should tasks be offloaded -- is carried
  out decentralized at the Road Side Units (RSUs) who also execute the tasks. By shifting
  control to the network edge, MACH moves away from the traditional centralized or
  vehicle-based handover method. Still, it focuses on contextual factors, such as
  the current RSU load and vehicle trajectories. Thus, MACH improves the overall Quality
  of Service (QoS) while fairly balancing computational loads between RSUs. To evaluate
  the effectiveness of our approach, we develop a robust simulation environment composed
  of real-world traffic data, dynamic network conditions, and different infrastructure
  capacities. For scenarios that demand low latency and high reliability, our experimental
  results demonstrate how MACH significantly improves the adaptability and efficiency
  of vehicular computations. By decentralizing control to the network edge, MACH effectively
  reduces communication overhead and optimizes resource utilization, offering a robust
  framework for task handover management.
