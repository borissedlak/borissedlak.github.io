abstract: Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations
  where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing autoscaling
  mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require alternative
  ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing services. To address
  these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling Platform (MUDAP) that
  supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both service- and resource-level dimensions.
  MUDAP supports service-specific scaling tailored to available parameters, e.g.,
  scale data quality or model size for a particular service. To optimize the execution
  across services, we present a scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural
  Knowledge (RASK). The RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns
  a continuous regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal
  scaling actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA
  and a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge
  device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in merely
  20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding elasticity
  dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less SLO violations,
  compared to baselines.
