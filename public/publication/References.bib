	abstract = {Die wachsende Anzahl an Internet of Things (IoT)-Geräten erzeugt eine erhebliche Menge an verschiedensten Daten, welche persönliche oder vertrauliche Informationen enthalten, die nicht für die Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind. Üblicherweise werden Datenschutzrichtlinien zum Schutz von sensiblen Daten über Systeme durchgesetzt, die über eine Vielzahl an Ressourcen verfügen, wie am Beispiel Cloud Computings. Die schiere Menge an Datenströmen, heterogenen Geräten, und involvierten Netzwerken beeinträchtigt jedoch die globale Latenz und erhöht mit zunehmender Distanz von der Datenquelle die Gefahr, dass Daten abgegriffen werden. Aus diesem Grund müssen Datenströme auf dem IoT-Gerät oder anderen Geräten in naher Umgebung aufbereitet werden, um den Schutz von persönlichen Daten zu gewährleistenIn dieser Arbeit präsentieren wir die Grundstruktur eines Systems, welches Datenströme innerhalb von Edge-Netzwerken zum Schutz von persönlichen Daten transformiert. Dies geschieht über leistungsfähige Geräte in der Nähe der Datenquelle. Jedes Mal, wenn ein IoT-Gerät sensitive Daten erfasst, wird der Datenstrom anhand einer Gruppe von Regeln umgeformt. Dieser Prozess ist über eine Reihe an Auslösern und Transformationen definiert (einem Datenschutzmodell), welche ein direktes Abbild der Datenschutzrichtlinien eines Interessenten darstellt. Unsere Arbeit beantwortet, wie Datenschutzrichtlinien in einem solchen Modell wiedergegeben und durch eine zugrundeliegende Verarbeitungsumgebung durchgesetzt werden könnenAls Nachweis für die Machbarkeit dieses Systems haben wir einen Prototyp entwickelt, der Video-Streams über ein Edge-Gerät leitet und dort transformiert. Die Ergebnisse haben gezeigt, dass das eingesetzte Gerät konstant in der Lage war menschliche Gesichter innerhalb von 15ms zu erkennen und zu anonymisieren. Demnach könnte dieser Video-Stream mit bis zu 60 Frames pro Sekunde (FPS) übertragen und transformiert werden, ohne Daten zu verlieren. Gekoppelt mit der niedrigen Latenz, die wir zwischen Stream-Rezipienten und Edge-Gerät gemessen haben, bietet unsere Arbeit vielversprechende Aussichten. Zukünftige Forschungsarbeit muss sich jedoch der Unterstützung von weiteren Datentypen widmen, um die allgemeine Eignung des Systems zu verdeutlichen.},

Given the system’s scale, the Service Level Objectives (SLOs), which are expressed as these requirements, must be disaggregated into smaller parts that can be decentralized. We present our framework for collaborative edge intelligence, enabling individual edge devices to (1) develop a causal understanding of how to enforce their SLOs and (2) transfer knowledge to speed up the onboarding of heterogeneous devices. Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming. Our results showed that edge devices required only ten training rounds to ensure four SLOs; furthermore, the underlying causal structures were also rationally explainable. The addition of new types of devices can be done a posteriori; the framework allowed them to reuse existing models, even though the device type had been unknown. Finally, rebalancing the load within a device cluster allowed individual edge devices to recover their SLO compliance after a network failure from 22\% to 89\%.},

	abstract = {Smart environments use composable microservices pipelines to process Internet of Things (IoT) data, where each service is dependent on the outcome of its predecessor. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS), individual services must fulfill Service Level Objectives (SLOs); however, SLO fulfillment is dependent on resources (e.g., processing or storage), which are scarcely available within the Edge. Hence, when distributing services over heterogeneous devices, this raises the question of where to deploy each service to best fulfill both its own SLOs as well as those imposed by dependent services. In this paper, we maximize SLO fulfillment of a pipeline-based application by analyzing these dependencies. To achieve this, services and hosting devices alike are extended with a Markov blanket (MB) – a probabilistic view into their internal processes – which are composed into one overarching model. Given a mutable set of services, hosts, and SLOs, the composed MB allows inferring the optimal assignment between services and edge devices. We evaluated our method for a smart city scenario, which assigned pipelined services (e.g., video processing) under constraints from subsequent services (e.g., consumer latency). The results showed how our method can support infrastructure providers by optimizing SLO fulfillment for arbitrary devices currently available.},

In this paper, we present a novel ML paradigm that is constructed upon Active Inference (ACI) – a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implemented a use case, in which an ACI-based agent continuously optimized the operation on a smart manufacturing engine according to QoS requirements. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. As a result, our agent required 5 cycles to converge to the optimal solution.},

	abstract = {Computing paradigms have evolved significantly in recent decades, moving from large room-sized resources (processors and memory) to incredibly small computing nodes. Recently, the power of computing has attracted almost all current application fields. Currently, distributed computing continuum systems (DCCSs) are unleashing the era of a computing paradigm that unifies various computing resources, including cloud, fog/edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile devices into a seamless and integrated continuum. Its seamless infrastructure efficiently manages diverse processing loads and ensures a consistent user experience. Furthermore, it provides a holistic solution to meet modern computing needs. In this context, this paper presents a deeper understanding of DCCSs’ potential in today’s computing environment. First, we discuss the evolution of computing paradigms up to DCCS. The general architectures, components, and various computing devices are discussed, and the benefits and limitations of each computing paradigm are analyzed. After that, our discussion continues into various computing devices that constitute part of DCCS to achieve computational goals in current and futuristic applications. In addition, we delve into the key features and benefits of DCCS from the perspective of current computing needs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of emerging applications (with a case study analysis) that desperately need DCCS architectures to perform their tasks. Finally, we describe the open challenges and possible developments that need to be made to DCCS to unleash its widespread potential for the majority of applications.},

If done centrally, this dramatically increases the number of devices and variables that must be considered, while creating an enormous communication overhead. To address this, we (1) introduce a causality filter based on Markov blankets (MB) that limits the number of variables that each device must track, (2) evaluate SLOs decentralized on a device basis, and (3) infer optimal device configuration for fulfilling SLOs. We evaluated our methodology by analyzing video stream transformations and providing device configurations that ensure the Quality of Service (QoS).

Besides performing computations, these devices also produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices, such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction. However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further, we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects the human body’s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first, it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is designed to minimize the system’s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance of a system through Bayesian network structure learning. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the governance and sustainability model, and we provide possible solutions to overcome them and make the system more efficient.},

	abstract = {The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it. Moving the data handling towards the edge of the computing spectrum guarantees better distribution of load and, in principle, lower latency and better privacy. However, managing such a structure is complex, especially when requirements, also referred to Service Level Objectives (SLOs), specified by applications' owners and infrastructure managers need to be ensured. Despite the rich number of proposals of Machine Learning (ML) based management solutions, researchers and practitioners yet struggle to guarantee long-term prediction and control, and accurate troubleshooting. Therefore, we present a novel ML paradigm based on Active Inference (AIF) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, thanks to AIF and its causal structures, our method guarantees full transparency on the decision making, making the interpretation of the results and the troubleshooting effortless.},

	abstract = {Handling heterogeneity and unpredictability are two core problems in pervasive computing. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on systems that adapt to changing requirements typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98\% fulfillment rate.},

	abstract = {In the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offloading is essential for guaranteeing the execution of perception tasks, e.g., mobile mapping or object detection. While existing work on offloading focused extensively on minimizing inter-vehicle networking latency, vehicle platoons (e.g., heavy-duty transport) present numerous other objectives, such as energy efficiency or data quality. To optimize these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) during operation, this work presents a purely Vehicle-to-Vehicle approach (V2V) for collaborative services offloading within a vehicle platoon. By training and using a Bayesian Network (BN), services can proactively decide to offload whenever this promises to improve platoon-wide SLO fulfillment; therefore, vehicles estimate how both sides would be impacted by offloading a service. In particular, this considers resource heterogeneity within the platoon to avoid overloading more restricted devices. We evaluate our approach in a physical setup, where vehicles in a platoon continuously (i.e., every 500 ms) interpret the SLOs of three perception services. Our probabilistic, predictive method shows promising results in handling large AV platoons; within seconds, it detects and resolves SLO violations through offloading.},

	abstract = {Every year, the amount of data created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases; therefore, data processing is carried out by edge devices in close proximity. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and adapted with the help of Machine Learning (ML). However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state and poor inference. In this paper, we present a novel ML paradigm that is constructed upon Active Inference (ACI) – a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implemented a use case, in which an ACI-based agent continuously optimized the operation on a smart manufacturing engine according to QoS requirements. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. As a result, our agent required 5 cycles to converge to the optimal solution.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2505.07827},
	abstract = {This paper introduces MACH, a novel approach for optimizing task handover in vehicular computing scenarios. To ensure fast and latency-aware placement of tasks, the decision-making -- where and when should tasks be offloaded -- is carried out decentralized at the Road Side Units (RSUs) who also execute the tasks. By shifting control to the network edge, MACH moves away from the traditional centralized or vehicle-based handover method. Still, it focuses on contextual factors, such as the current RSU load and vehicle trajectories. Thus, MACH improves the overall Quality of Service (QoS) while fairly balancing computational loads between RSUs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we develop a robust simulation environment composed of real-world traffic data, dynamic network conditions, and different infrastructure capacities. For scenarios that demand low latency and high reliability, our experimental results demonstrate how MACH significantly improves the adaptability and efficiency of vehicular computations. By decentralizing control to the network edge, MACH effectively reduces communication overhead and optimizes resource utilization, offering a robust framework for task handover management.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2503.03274},
	abstract = {Ensuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in large-scale architectures, such as Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), is challenging due to their heterogeneous nature and varying service requirements across different devices and applications. Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2505.24618},
	abstract = {The Computing Continuum (CC) is an emerging Internet-based computing paradigm that spans from local Internet of Things sensors and constrained edge devices to large-scale cloud data centers. Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of CC platforms demands distributed intelligence for adaptive and resilient service management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and deployed alongside distributed services to manage them autonomously. Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90\% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80\% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start. Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in CC platforms.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2510.06882},
	abstract = {Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28\% less SLO violations, compared to baselines.},

We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.},
