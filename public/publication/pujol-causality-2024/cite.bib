 abstract = {As distributed continuum systems (DCSs) are envisioned, they will have a massive impact on our future society. Hence, it is of utmost importance to ensure that their impact is socially responsible. Equipping these systems with causal models brings features such as explainability, accountability, and auditability, which are needed to provide the right level of trust. Furthermore, by combining causality with graph-based service-level objectives, we can cope with dynamic and complex system requirements while achieving sustainable development of DCSs’ capacities and applications.},
