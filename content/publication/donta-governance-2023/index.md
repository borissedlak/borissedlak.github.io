abstract: 'Distributed computing continuum systems (DCCS) make use of a vast number
  of computing devices to process data generated by edge devices such as the Internet
  of Things and sensor nodes. Besides performing computations, these devices also
  produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management
  information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices,
  such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction.
  However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes
  due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various
  challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize
  the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools
  that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further,
  we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects
  the human body’s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first,
  it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge
  to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to
  autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is
  designed to minimize the system’s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small
  set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance
  of a system through Bayesian network structure learning. Finally, we discuss the
  limitations of the governance and sustainability model, and we provide possible
  solutions to overcome them and make the system more efficient.'
