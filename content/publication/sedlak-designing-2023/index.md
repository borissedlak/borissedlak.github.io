abstract: Compute Continuum (CC) systems comprise a vast number of devices distributed
  over computational tiers. Evaluating business requirements, i.e., Service Level
  Objectives (SLOs), requires collecting data from all those devices; if SLOs are
  violated, devices must be reconfigured to ensure correct operation. If done centrally,
  this dramatically increases the number of devices and variables that must be considered,
  while creating an enormous communication overhead. To address this, we (1) introduce
  a causality filter based on Markov blankets (MB) that limits the number of variables
  that each device must track, (2) evaluate SLOs decentralized on a device basis,
  and (3) infer optimal device configuration for fulfilling SLOs. We evaluated our
  methodology by analyzing video stream transformations and providing device configurations
  that ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). The devices thus perceived their environment
  and acted accordingly – a form of decentralized intelligence.
