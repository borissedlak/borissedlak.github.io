abstract: 'Ensuring Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in large-scale architectures,
  such as Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS), is challenging due to their
  heterogeneous nature and varying service requirements across different devices and
  applications. Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead
  to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS,
  one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often
  left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference—an
  emerging method from neuroscience—against three established reinforcement learning
  algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization).
  We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing
  application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective
  algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and
  bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters, including the number of streams,
  frame rate, and resolution, to optimize service quality and user experience. To
  test algorithms’ adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically
  changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network
  bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated
  algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that
  Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering
  lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.'
