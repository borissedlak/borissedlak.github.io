abstract: Every year, the amount of data created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices
  increases; therefore, data processing is carried out by edge devices in close proximity.
  To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised
  and adapted with the help of Machine Learning (ML). However, as long as ML models
  are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution,
  leading to an inaccurate view of the system state and poor inference. In this paper,
  we present a novel ML paradigm that is constructed upon Active Inference (ACI) â€“
  a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and
  evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implemented a use
  case, in which an ACI-based agent continuously optimized the operation on a smart
  manufacturing engine according to QoS requirements. The agent used causal knowledge
  to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements
  fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. As a result, our agent required
  5 cycles to converge to the optimal solution.
