 abstract = {Computing paradigms have evolved significantly in recent decades, moving from large room-sized resources (processors and memory) to incredibly small computing nodes. Recently, the power of computing has attracted almost all current application fields. Currently, distributed computing continuum systems (DCCSs) are unleashing the era of a computing paradigm that unifies various computing resources, including cloud, fog/edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile devices into a seamless and integrated continuum. Its seamless infrastructure efficiently manages diverse processing loads and ensures a consistent user experience. Furthermore, it provides a holistic solution to meet modern computing needs. In this context, this paper presents a deeper understanding of DCCSs’ potential in today’s computing environment. First, we discuss the evolution of computing paradigms up to DCCS. The general architectures, components, and various computing devices are discussed, and the benefits and limitations of each computing paradigm are analyzed. After that, our discussion continues into various computing devices that constitute part of DCCS to achieve computational goals in current and futuristic applications. In addition, we delve into the key features and benefits of DCCS from the perspective of current computing needs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of emerging applications (with a case study analysis) that desperately need DCCS architectures to perform their tasks. Finally, we describe the open challenges and possible developments that need to be made to DCCS to unleash its widespread potential for the majority of applications.},
