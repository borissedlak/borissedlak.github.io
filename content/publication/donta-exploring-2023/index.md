abstract: Computing paradigms have evolved significantly in recent decades, moving
  from large room-sized resources (processors and memory) to incredibly small computing
  nodes. Recently, the power of computing has attracted almost all current application
  fields. Currently, distributed computing continuum systems (DCCSs) are unleashing
  the era of a computing paradigm that unifies various computing resources, including
  cloud, fog/edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile devices into
  a seamless and integrated continuum. Its seamless infrastructure efficiently manages
  diverse processing loads and ensures a consistent user experience. Furthermore,
  it provides a holistic solution to meet modern computing needs. In this context,
  this paper presents a deeper understanding of DCCSs’ potential in today’s computing
  environment. First, we discuss the evolution of computing paradigms up to DCCS.
  The general architectures, components, and various computing devices are discussed,
  and the benefits and limitations of each computing paradigm are analyzed. After
  that, our discussion continues into various computing devices that constitute part
  of DCCS to achieve computational goals in current and futuristic applications. In
  addition, we delve into the key features and benefits of DCCS from the perspective
  of current computing needs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of
  emerging applications (with a case study analysis) that desperately need DCCS architectures
  to perform their tasks. Finally, we describe the open challenges and possible developments
  that need to be made to DCCS to unleash its widespread potential for the majority
  of applications.
