abstract: 'Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
  constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity
  dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically
  adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize
  requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling
  agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and
  Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel:
  YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all
  agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While
  the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges
  quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
  practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability
  of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage
  future work in this research direction.'
