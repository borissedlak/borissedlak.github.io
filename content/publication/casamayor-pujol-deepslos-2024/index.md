abstract: The advent of the computing continuum, i.e., the blending of all existing
  computational tiers, calls for novel techniques and methods that consider its complex
  dynamics. This work presents the DeepSLO as a novel design paradigm to define and
  structure Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for distributed computing continuum systems.
  Hence, when multiple stakeholders are involved, the DeepSLO allows them to plan
  the overarching behaviors of the system. Further, the techniques employed (Bayesian
  networks, Markov blanket, Active inference) provide autonomy and decentralization
  to each SLO while the DeepSLO hierarchy remains to account for objectives dependencies.
  Finally, DeepSLOs are represented graphically, as well as individual SLOs enabling
  a human interpretation of the system performance.
