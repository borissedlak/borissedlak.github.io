abstract: As distributed continuum systems (DCSs) are envisioned, they will have a
  massive impact on our future society. Hence, it is of utmost importance to ensure
  that their impact is socially responsible. Equipping these systems with causal models
  brings features such as explainability, accountability, and auditability, which
  are needed to provide the right level of trust. Furthermore, by combining causality
  with graph-based service-level objectives, we can cope with dynamic and complex
  system requirements while achieving sustainable development of DCSs’ capacities
  and applications.
