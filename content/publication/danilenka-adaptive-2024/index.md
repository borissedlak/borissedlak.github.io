abstract: Handling heterogeneity and unpredictability are two core problems in pervasive
  computing. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational
  resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the
  needs of all participants. Existing work on systems that adapt to changing requirements
  typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level
  Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level
  control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable
  complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing
  from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive
  agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive
  systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead
  of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt
  to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of AIF agents with an extensive
  experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application
  scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different
  resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence
  that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the
  AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure
  up to 98% fulfillment rate.
