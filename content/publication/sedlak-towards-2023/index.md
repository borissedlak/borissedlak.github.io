abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for sharing privacy-sensitive
  data across federations of independent organizations, taking particular regard to
  flexibility and efficiency. Our approach benefits from data meshes and serverless
  computing – such as flexible ad-hoc composability or minimal operational overheads
  – to streamline data sharing phases, and to effectively and flexibly address the
  specific requirements of highly variable data sharing constellations.
