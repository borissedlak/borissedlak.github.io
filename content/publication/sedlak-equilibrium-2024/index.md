abstract: Computing Continuum (CC) systems are challenged to ensure the intricate
  requirements of each computational tier. Given the systemâ€™s scale, the Service Level
  Objectives (SLOs), which are expressed as these requirements, must be disaggregated
  into smaller parts that can be decentralized. We present our framework for collaborative
  edge intelligence, enabling individual edge devices to (1) develop a causal understanding
  of how to enforce their SLOs and (2) transfer knowledge to speed up the onboarding
  of heterogeneous devices. Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of
  SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which
  a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of
  Experience (QoE) during video streaming. Our results showed that edge devices required
  only ten training rounds to ensure four SLOs; furthermore, the underlying causal
  structures were also rationally explainable. The addition of new types of devices
  can be done a posteriori; the framework allowed them to reuse existing models, even
  though the device type had been unknown. Finally, rebalancing the load within a
  device cluster allowed individual edge devices to recover their SLO compliance after
  a network failure from 22% to 89%.
