	abstract = {Die wachsende Anzahl an Internet of Things (IoT)-Geräten erzeugt eine erhebliche Menge an verschiedensten Daten, welche persönliche oder vertrauliche Informationen enthalten, die nicht für die Öffentlichkeit bestimmt sind. Üblicherweise werden Datenschutzrichtlinien zum Schutz von sensiblen Daten über Systeme durchgesetzt, die über eine Vielzahl an Ressourcen verfügen, wie am Beispiel Cloud Computings. Die schiere Menge an Datenströmen, heterogenen Geräten, und involvierten Netzwerken beeinträchtigt jedoch die globale Latenz und erhöht mit zunehmender Distanz von der Datenquelle die Gefahr, dass Daten abgegriffen werden. Aus diesem Grund müssen Datenströme auf dem IoT-Gerät oder anderen Geräten in naher Umgebung aufbereitet werden, um den Schutz von persönlichen Daten zu gewährleistenIn dieser Arbeit präsentieren wir die Grundstruktur eines Systems, welches Datenströme innerhalb von Edge-Netzwerken zum Schutz von persönlichen Daten transformiert. Dies geschieht über leistungsfähige Geräte in der Nähe der Datenquelle. Jedes Mal, wenn ein IoT-Gerät sensitive Daten erfasst, wird der Datenstrom anhand einer Gruppe von Regeln umgeformt. Dieser Prozess ist über eine Reihe an Auslösern und Transformationen definiert (einem Datenschutzmodell), welche ein direktes Abbild der Datenschutzrichtlinien eines Interessenten darstellt. Unsere Arbeit beantwortet, wie Datenschutzrichtlinien in einem solchen Modell wiedergegeben und durch eine zugrundeliegende Verarbeitungsumgebung durchgesetzt werden könnenAls Nachweis für die Machbarkeit dieses Systems haben wir einen Prototyp entwickelt, der Video-Streams über ein Edge-Gerät leitet und dort transformiert. Die Ergebnisse haben gezeigt, dass das eingesetzte Gerät konstant in der Lage war menschliche Gesichter innerhalb von 15ms zu erkennen und zu anonymisieren. Demnach könnte dieser Video-Stream mit bis zu 60 Frames pro Sekunde (FPS) übertragen und transformiert werden, ohne Daten zu verlieren. Gekoppelt mit der niedrigen Latenz, die wir zwischen Stream-Rezipienten und Edge-Gerät gemessen haben, bietet unsere Arbeit vielversprechende Aussichten. Zukünftige Forschungsarbeit muss sich jedoch der Unterstützung von weiteren Datentypen widmen, um die allgemeine Eignung des Systems zu verdeutlichen.},

	abstract = {Smart environments use composable microservices pipelines to process Internet of Things (IoT) data, where each service is dependent on the outcome of its predecessor. To ensure Quality of Service (QoS), individual services must fulfill Service Level Objectives (SLOs); however, SLO fulfillment is dependent on resources (e.g., processing or storage), which are scarcely available within the Edge. Hence, when distributing services over heterogeneous devices, this raises the question of where to deploy each service to best fulfill both its own SLOs as well as those imposed by dependent services. In this paper, we maximize SLO fulfillment of a pipeline-based application by analyzing these dependencies. To achieve this, services and hosting devices alike are extended with a Markov blanket (MB) – a probabilistic view into their internal processes – which are composed into one overarching model. Given a mutable set of services, hosts, and SLOs, the composed MB allows inferring the optimal assignment between services and edge devices. We evaluated our method for a smart city scenario, which assigned pipelined services (e.g., video processing) under constraints from subsequent services (e.g., consumer latency). The results showed how our method can support infrastructure providers by optimizing SLO fulfillment for arbitrary devices currently available.},

To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) throughout these operations, systems are supervised and adapted with the help of Machine Learning (ML). However, as long as ML models are not retrained, they fail to capture gradual shifts in the variable distribution, leading to an inaccurate view of the system state and poor inference. In this paper, we present a novel ML paradigm that is constructed upon Active Inference (ACI) – a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implemented a use case, in which an ACI-based agent continuously optimized the operation on a smart manufacturing engine according to QoS requirements. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. As a result, our agent required 5 cycles to converge to the optimal solution.},

	abstract = {Computing paradigms have evolved significantly in recent decades, moving from large room-sized resources (processors and memory) to incredibly small computing nodes. Recently, the power of computing has attracted almost all current application fields. Currently, distributed computing continuum systems (DCCSs) are unleashing the era of a computing paradigm that unifies various computing resources, including cloud, fog/edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile devices into a seamless and integrated continuum. Its seamless infrastructure efficiently manages diverse processing loads and ensures a consistent user experience. Furthermore, it provides a holistic solution to meet modern computing needs. In this context, this paper presents a deeper understanding of DCCSs’ potential in today’s computing environment. First, we discuss the evolution of computing paradigms up to DCCS. The general architectures, components, and various computing devices are discussed, and the benefits and limitations of each computing paradigm are analyzed. After that, our discussion continues into various computing devices that constitute part of DCCS to achieve computational goals in current and futuristic applications. In addition, we delve into the key features and benefits of DCCS from the perspective of current computing needs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of emerging applications (with a case study analysis) that desperately need DCCS architectures to perform their tasks. Finally, we describe the open challenges and possible developments that need to be made to DCCS to unleash its widespread potential for the majority of applications.},

If done centrally, this dramatically increases the number of devices and variables that must be considered, while creating an enormous communication overhead. To address this, we (1) introduce a causality filter based on Markov blankets (MB) that limits the number of variables that each device must track, (2) evaluate SLOs decentralized on a device basis, and (3) infer optimal device configuration for fulfilling SLOs. We evaluated our methodology by analyzing video stream transformations and providing device configurations that ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). The devices thus perceived their environment and acted accordingly – a form of decentralized intelligence.},

Besides performing computations, these devices also produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices, such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction. However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further, we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects the human body’s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first, it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is designed to minimize the system’s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance of a system through Bayesian network structure learning. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the governance and sustainability model, and we provide possible solutions to overcome them and make the system more efficient.},

	abstract = {The current scenario of IoT is witnessing a constant increase on the volume of data, which is generated in constant stream, calling for novel architectural and logical solutions for processing it. Moving the data handling towards the edge of the computing spectrum guarantees better distribution of load and, in principle, lower latency and better privacy. However, managing such a structure is complex, especially when requirements, also referred to Service Level Objectives (SLOs), specified by applications' owners and infrastructure managers need to be ensured. Despite the rich number of proposals of Machine Learning (ML) based management solutions, researchers and practitioners yet struggle to guarantee long-term prediction and control, and accurate troubleshooting. Therefore, we present a novel ML paradigm based on Active Inference (AIF) -- a concept from neuroscience that describes how the brain constantly predicts and evaluates sensory information to decrease long-term surprise. We implement it and evaluate it in a heterogeneous real stream processing use case, where an AIF-based agent continuously optimizes the fulfillment of three SLOs for three autonomous driving services running on multiple devices. The agent used causal knowledge to gradually develop an understanding of how its actions are related to requirements fulfillment, and which configurations to favor. Through this approach, our agent requires up to thirty iterations to converge to the optimal solution, showing the capability of offering accurate results in a short amount of time. Furthermore, thanks to AIF and its causal structures, our method guarantees full transparency on the decision making, making the interpretation of the results and the troubleshooting effortless.},

	abstract = {In the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offloading is essential for guaranteeing the execution of perception tasks, e.g., mobile mapping or object detection. While existing work focused extensively on minimizing inter-vehicle networking latency through offloading, other objectives become relevant in the case of vehicle platoons, e.g., energy efficiency or data quality for heavy-duty or public transport. Therefore, we aim to enforce these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) through intelligent task offloading within AV platoons. We present a collaborative framework for handling and offloading services in a purely Vehicle-to-Vehicle approach (V2V) based on Bayesian Networks (BNs). Each service aggregates local observations into a platoon-wide understanding of how to ensure SLOs for heterogeneous vehicle types. With the resulting models, services can proactively decide to offload if this promises to improve global SLO fulfillment. We evaluate the approach in a real-case setting, where vehicles in a platoon continuously (i.e., every 500 ms) interpret the SLOs of three actual perception services. Our probabilistic, predictive method shows promising results in handling large AV platoons; within seconds, it detects and resolves SLO violations through offloading.},
